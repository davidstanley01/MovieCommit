Pulp Fiction
Oh I'm sorry, did I break your concentration?
That's how you're gonna beat 'em, Butch. They keep underestimating you.
If my answers frighten you then you should cease asking scary questions.
Aw, man, I shot Marvin in the face.
That's a pretty fucking good milkshake. I don't know if it's worth five dollars but it's pretty fucking good.
English mother fucker, do you speak it?
Say "What" again. Say it one more god damn time! I dare you! I double dare you mother fucker!
I'm sorry. Did I break your concentration? Oh, you were finished. Well, allow me to retort.
God damn that's a pretty fucking good milkshake.
Zed's dead, baby. Zed's dead.
Uncomfortable silences. Why do we feel it's necessary to yak about bull s**t in order to be comfortable?
We're all gonna be like three little Fonzies here.

Does he look like a bitch?

I'm the foot fuckin' master.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go home and have a heart attack.
Well, let's not start sucking each other's dicks quite yet.
Shut the fuck up, fat man! This ain't none of your goddamn business.
What country are you from?
Well, I'm a mushroom-cloud-layin' motherfucker, motherfucker!
That's thirty minutes away. I'll be there in ten.
Bring out the Gimp.
