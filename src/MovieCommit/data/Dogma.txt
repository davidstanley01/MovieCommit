Dogma
You masturbate more than anyone on the planet.
What, are you insinuating that I don't have what it takes anymore?
I know they were just kids, but we kicked their fucken pube-less asses!
Come on, demon, I wanna see you try that shit on someone who's already dead!
Anyone who isn't dead or from another plane of existence would do well to cover their ears right about now.
No ticket.
The whole fucking world's against us, dude, I swear to God.
I feel like I'm Han Solo, and you're Chewie, and she's Ben Kenobi, and we're in that fucked-up bar.
New Jersey? That doesn't sound like much of a crusade.
